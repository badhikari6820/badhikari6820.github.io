My name is Basanta Adhikari. I am a Computer Engineering major with a minor in Computer Science at the University of Maryland in Baltimore County (UMBC). I graduated from Baltimore City Community College with an Associateâ€™s Degree in Engineering. My goal is to fabricate the internet of things equipped with artificial intelligence. My research focuses on the engineering design and efficiency optimization of the onboard sensors and computers. The approach of this research is to be able to analyze correlation between engineering design and efficiency of onboard electronics to attain the maximum threshold performance. I am passionate about Eastern Classical Music. I have received several awards and recognitions for my expertise in playing tabla. I am a NASA Community College Scholar and an honored student of Granville T. Woods Society.
